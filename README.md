# Othell.io

Othell.io is an online implementation of the classic board game Othello, featuring AI that utilises minimax and alpha-beta pruning. Available to play at https://othell.io/.

This project was part of my A Level NEA (hence the unecessary object-oriented approach), and was the first program I built using JavaScript.
